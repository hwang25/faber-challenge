# Faber Product Review API

The purpose of the coding challenge was to engineer a REST API that to handle product reviews, purchases, and payment transactions.

• Backend: Express.js

• NoSQL Database: PostgreSQL

• Frontend: React

## Features

Endpoints have been created in [queries.js](https://github.com/hwang25/faber-challenge/blob/master/queries.js) for products, payments, and broadcasts.

• Products: GET, PUT, DELETE

• Payments: POST

• Broadcast: GET, PUT, DELETE

PostgreSQL is used as the database to store newly added products, purchases, and transactions. These endpoints are exported at the end and connected to the Express app created in [index.js](https://github.com/hwang25/faber-challenge/blob/master/queries.js).
